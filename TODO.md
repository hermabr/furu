- [ ] high-level skeleton
    - [x] doing `class MyCls(Furu[int])` should make it a frozen dataclass with named args
    - [ ] furu_hash
    - [ ] schema
    - [ ] furu config
    - [ ] state
- [ ] manual serializer for saving objects
    - [ ] start with cloudpickle for dev
    - [ ] roll my own, where it auto saves using a pytree-like strategy and allows users to register handlers
- [ ] trace code at runtime to find all functions and save/hash their ast
- [ ] file/compute locking
    - [ ] auto make/delete the lock file
    - [ ] don't allow others to run if file is locked
    - [ ] heartbeat and waiting
- [ ] use a pytree-like approach for walking the config
- [ ] metadata
    - [ ] basic metadata
    - [ ] load from metadata
    - [ ] record the git diff
    - [ ] support time traveling to a previous experiment
- [ ] error handling
    - [ ] capture errors
    - [ ] make the errors informative
    - [ ] use rich tracebacks
- [ ] logging
    - [ ] log when loading or creating object
    - [ ] record log in furu_dir
- [ ] querying/filtering
- [ ] migration
- [ ] executor
    - [ ] local
    - [ ] slurm workers
    - [ ] slurm dag
    - [ ] time traveling executor (maybe i need git worktrees for this?)
    - [ ] dependencies
- [ ] furu list
- [ ] dashboard
- [ ] mytest-wrapper
- [ ] for the future
    - [ ] have method for making the raw data so that we have some sort of tracking
